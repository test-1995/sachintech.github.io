        <p class="p1">An immersive website is the first online digital address of your business. Having a coherent website with the right UI/UX parameters is a must. Our web development team strikes the perfect balance between creative and technical finesse to make your website an attractive address for your brand, whether it is static, dynamic or e-commerce. We also create apps along with web development.</p>
        <h1>Identify the kind of website you should have, based on your present business status</h1>
        <div class="s2div1">
            <h3>START-UP APPROACH</h3>
            <p>If your business is a start-up or you are just starting out wherein you need a simple/one-pager website just for conveying information about your business and do not have to put out constant updates, then having a static website would be the best option. We help you out with such a website which can be later upgraded as your requirements change with time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="s2div2">
            <h3>SERVICE-ORIENTED APPROACH</h3>
            <p>Being a service provider, it is important to have a detailed website in order to make it easier for your customers to find you. Also, timely updation of your expertise on your website in the form of blogs/case studies is a must. In such a case, we can help you with setting up an amazing dynamic website along with facilitating an admin panel.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="s2div3">
            <h3>PRODUCT-ORIENTED APPROACH</h3>
            <p>If your business sells lots of products, then a dynamic website with online payment functionality is the minimum baseline you should aim for irrespective of whether you are a B2B or B2C company. Moreover, since your product range will need to be updated and selling online is the new way of retail, having an e-commerce website is the best way to go. We help you do the same.</p>
